## Project-Specific Context

This is a WinUI 3 desktop application that:
- Uses the GitHub Copilot SDK (v0.1.24-preview.0) for chat functionality with 5-minute timeouts for complex operations
- Integrates with Windows taskbar via System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon
- Detects active Windows Explorer folders and applications for context
- Identifies WSL distributions when Windows Terminal shows Unix-style prompts
- Collects relevant environment variables (PYTHONPATH, NODE_ENV, DOTNET_ROOT, etc.)
- Maintains conversation history (last 10 messages) for context continuity
- Uses Windows Accessibility API (UI Automation) as fallback for enhanced context inference
- Shows "Thinking..." placeholder while processing requests
- Persists chat history in SQLite
- Targets .NET 11 Preview with partial trimming on ARM64 and x64
- Full Native AOT disabled due to WinUI 3 incompatibility (data binding, XAML resources)

### Context Inference Strategy

The application infers user intent/questions/problems using a **tiered optimization strategy**:

**Tier 1: Quick Detection (10-50ms)**
- Win32 Z-order walking for active focus
- Detects Explorer paths, Terminal windows, IDEs (VS Code, Visual Studio, Rider)
- Strong context = early exit to skip heavier operations

**Tier 2: Medium Detection (100-200ms)**
- File System Context: Open Explorer windows (Shell COM APIs)
- Application Context: Visible windows (Win32 EnumWindows)
- **Screenshot Capture**: Only when context is weak/ambiguous (Base64 JPEG, 1024px max)
- Runs in parallel with other Tier 2 operations

**Tier 3: Heavy Detection (500ms+)**
- Only for developer scenarios (project folders detected)
- WSL distributions
- Background services (Docker, databases, language servers)

**Always Included:**
- System environment (OS, user)

**Fallback Mechanism:**
- Windows Accessibility API (UI Automation) when Win32 insufficient
- Extracts focused UI element details, control hierarchy, and process info

**Screenshot Optimization:**
- Skipped when strong text context exists (Explorer path, Terminal, IDE)
- Only captured for ambiguous scenarios where visual context adds value
- Prevents unnecessary OCR/vision processing latency on LLM side

**Environment Variables Collected:**
- PATH (filtered to remove common Windows system paths)
- PYTHONPATH, NODE_ENV, JAVA_HOME, GOPATH, CARGO_HOME
- DOTNET_ROOT, DOTNET_CLI_HOME, DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR, MSBuildSDKsPath

**WSL Distribution Detection:**
- Detects Unix-style prompts in Windows Terminal (e.g., "user@hostname:~")
- Checks running WSL distributions via `wsl --list --verbose`
- Reports single running distro, or lists multiple for disambiguation

**Conversation History:**
- Last 10 messages (5 exchanges) included with each request
- Enables context continuity ("install podman" → "uninstall it")
- Model maintains awareness of previous actions and environments

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **System Tray Icon**: Uses official Microsoft System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon API instead of third-party libraries for maximum reliability
2. **Deployment**: Self-contained deployment required for unpackaged WinUI 3 applications
3. **SDK Integration**: Direct usage of GitHub.Copilot.SDK NuGet package with JSON-RPC communication to bundled Copilot CLI
4. **Authentication**: Authentication via GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`) required

## System Prompt Guidelines

The application uses a comprehensive system prompt that instructs the model to:

1. **Avoid Markdown**: Use plain conversational text (no bold, bullets, headers)
2. **Context Continuity**: Review recent conversation to understand active environment/tools
3. **Be Actionable**: Execute imperative commands (install, uninstall, start, stop) immediately
4. **Report Partial Progress**: For multi-step operations, report what succeeded even if later steps fail
   - Example: "Successfully installed podman and started MySQL, but port verification failed: [error]"
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Use same action-oriented approach for related commands
6. **Prioritize Context**: When WSL distribution active, prioritize that environment over Windows tools
7. **Accuracy Critical**: Only state facts you're certain about; acknowledge uncertainty

## Important Constraints

- Partial trimming enabled (.NET 11 Preview) for size optimization
- Native AOT not compatible with WinUI 3 (XAML data binding, resources, and dynamic types)
- Single-file publish is incompatible with WinUI 3 + trimming
- The Copilot CLI is bundled with the SDK (no separate installation required)
- Request timeout is 300 seconds (5 minutes) for complex multi-step operations

## Type Safety Considerations

### SDK Type System (v0.1.24)

The GitHub Copilot SDK v0.1.24-preview.0 uses internal types that are not fully exposed in the public API surface. This requires careful handling:

**Current Approach:**
- Use `dynamic` for SDK session and response handling
- Apply pattern matching for null-safe access: `if (responseEvent?.Data?.Content is string content)`
- Add inline comments explaining type trade-offs

**Rationale:**
- SDK's `SendAndWaitAsync` returns internal `AssistantMessageEvent?` type
- Session types are not publicly exposed in v0.1.24
- `dynamic` provides flexibility for SDK evolution between versions
- Pattern matching (`is` operator) enables type-safe extraction while working with dynamic

**Best Practices:**
```csharp
// Good: Pattern matching for type-safe null checks
if (responseEvent?.Data?.Content is string content)
{
    return content;
}

// Avoid: Direct access without null safety
string content = responseEvent.Data.Content; // Nullable warning

// Avoid: Excessive null-forgiving operators
string content = responseEvent!.Data!.Content!; // Fragile
```

**Future Improvements:**
When SDK exposes public types (likely v0.2.x+), migrate to:
```csharp
AssistantMessageEvent? responseEvent = await session.SendAndWaitAsync(...);
if (responseEvent?.Data?.Content is string content)
{
    return content;
}
```

## Debugging

### CopilotService Diagnostics

Detailed timing diagnostics are logged to Debug Console in VS Code:

1. **Launch with F5** in VS Code (requires debugger attached)
2. **View → Debug Console** to see output
3. **Look for [CopilotService] logs** showing:
   - Stage 1: CLI startup time
   - Stage 2: Session creation time
   - Stage 3: Model response time (this is where most time is spent)
   - Full prompt content
   - Complete model response
   - Total request duration

**Timeout Diagnostics:**
When timeout occurs, logs show:
- Exact stage where timeout happened
- Total elapsed time
- TimeoutException details with stack trace

**Example Output:**
```
[CopilotService] ===== Request START at 14:23:45.123 =====
[CopilotService] Stage 1 (CLI Start): 0.05s
[CopilotService] Stage 2 (Session Create): 0.12s
[CopilotService] ===== PROMPT (2345 chars) =====
[CopilotService] <full prompt content>
[CopilotService] ===== END PROMPT =====
[CopilotService] Stage 3 (Sending to model)...
[CopilotService] Stage 3 (Model Response): 18.42s
[CopilotService] Total request time: 18.59s
[CopilotService] ===== RESPONSE (1234 chars) =====
[CopilotService] <model response>
[CopilotService] ===== END RESPONSE =====
```

### Launch Configuration

`.vscode/launch.json` is configured for ARM64 debugging with:
- Pre-launch build task
- Internal console with auto-open
- `justMyCode: false` for SDK debugging

## Known Issues

### TextBox Cursor Spacing Bug

**Symptom**: As you type in the input box, increasing space appears between text and cursor

**Root Cause**: WinUI 3 TextBox/RichEditBox layout bug that causes text measurement to desync from cursor position

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✗ Variable font removal (Segoe UI Variable → Segoe UI)
2. ✗ Explicit CharacterSpacing=0
3. ✗ Monospace font (Consolas)
4. ✗ UseLayoutRounding=False
5. ✗ RichEditBox control (different rendering path)
6. ✓ AutoSuggestBox control (FIXED)

**Final Solution**: 
```xaml
<AutoSuggestBox x:Name="InputBox"
                PlaceholderText="Ask GitHub Copilot..."
                FontFamily="Segoe UI"
                FontSize="16"
                Padding="12,8,12,8"
                QuerySubmitted="InputBox_QuerySubmitted"
                TextChanged="InputBox_TextChanged"
                KeyDown="InputBox_KeyDown"/>
```

```csharp
private async void InputBox_QuerySubmitted(AutoSuggestBox sender, AutoSuggestBoxQuerySubmittedEventArgs args)
{
    // Handle Enter key press
    await SendMessageAsync();
}
```

**Key Findings**:
- Issue affects TextBox and RichEditBox controls in WinUI 3
- AutoSuggestBox uses different text rendering implementation that avoids the cursor positioning bug
- Research indicated TextBoxView.cpp measurement/positioning desynchronization in TextBox/RichEditBox
- No documented official fixes from Microsoft for TextBox/RichEditBox
- AutoSuggestBox successfully avoids the issue

**Status**: ✓ Resolved by switching to AutoSuggestBox.

### SDK/CLI Compatibility

**Issue**: SDK versions may require specific CLI versions.
**Resolution**: The SDK now bundles the correct CLI version, reducing compatibility issues.

**Monitoring**: Debug logs will show if CLI startup or session creation fails

## UI Design Principles

### Typography

All UI elements use **Segoe UI** font family with standardized sizes for Windows 11 native appearance:

- **Standard content**: 16pt (chat messages, input box)
- **Secondary text**: 13pt (timestamps, metadata)
- **Headers**: 16pt (message sender names)
- **Icons**: 16pt (buttons, interface elements)

**Text Scaling**: WinUI 3 automatically respects Windows text scaling settings (Settings → Accessibility → Text size). Font sizes are base values that scale with user preferences.

**Previous Variation Fonts Removed**: The application originally used "Segoe UI Variable Display" and "Segoe UI Variable Text" which contributed to the TextBox cursor spacing bug. Plain "Segoe UI" provides better consistency and avoids rendering issues.

### Input Control

- **AutoSuggestBox** for message input:
  - Handles Enter key via `QuerySubmitted` event
  - Avoids TextBox/RichEditBox cursor spacing bug
  - Maintains Windows 11 native look and feel
  - Up/Down arrows for command history navigation
